# Hangman-Game
Overview
In this project I created an app so you can play the popular game Hangman. The app will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML powered by JavaScript code. The user will be guessing the popular characters from the Land of Ooo, in Adventure Time.
It's a simple to game to flex those JavaScript muscles.

Given Guidelines for the Project

    Choose a theme for your game!
    Use key events to listen for the letters that your players will type.
    Display the following on the page:
        Press any key to get started!
        Wins
        Number of Guesses Remaining: *Letters Already Guessed
    After the user wins/loses, the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.
